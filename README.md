# Brain-Controlled Devices
## Overview
  The neurons in the human brain send commands in the form of brain waves to other parts of the body to control them. Electroencephalography (EEG) technology allows humans to read and interpret those brain waves and convert them into commands that computers can run. This project serves to test the current capabilities of EEG technology and shed light on its potential.

  In the first semester, we tested whether EEG commands, translated using a provided API, from an EMOTIV EEG headset would allow a user to control a Tello drone. Then, in the second semester we tested if a Unitree Go1 Robot dog could be controlled using the same EMOTIV EEG headset.  We found that EEG technology and its current capabilities were able to accomplish the needed tasks, but not without issues.
